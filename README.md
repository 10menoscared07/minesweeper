# The History of Minesweeper

Minesweeper has roots in the early days of computing, with predecessors appearing as far back as the 1960s. It rose to global fame when bundled with Microsoft Windows in 1992, quickly becoming a beloved pastime for millions. Its addictive simplicity and challenging mechanics made it a perfect game for sharpening problem-solving skill

# How Minesweeper Works

At its core, Minesweeper challenges players to uncover all safe cells on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. Each move requires strategic thinking and careful planning. Here's how the magic happens:

- **Mine Placement**: Mines are randomly distributed across the grid at the start of the game. Each game is a unique puzzle waiting to be solved.
  
- **Numbering: Every**: uncovered cell displays a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it. This is the key to solving the puzzle.
  
- **Flood Fill**: When a safe cell with no adjacent mines is clicked, the game reveals all connected empty cells in a satisfying cascade, helping you clear large sections of the board.
  

# Controls

- You can place a flag at a tile using `right mouse click` ( and undo it as well )
